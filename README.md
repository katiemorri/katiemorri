## Hey! 👋

My name is Kathryn Morrison and I'm a Masters student at Johns Hopkins University studying Biotechnology. I focus on bioinformatics, especially scientific computation concerning protein analysis.

- 🔭 I’m currently examining phosphorylation in the [RYR1 Protein](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8X48), a protein that helps regulate skeletal muscle cell activity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cutting-edge scientific computing tools and LLM-based tools for protein modeling and analysis.
- 💬 Looking for roles and projects in bioinformatics-- please reach out if you'd like to chat!
- 📫 How to reach me: katiecmorrison@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a local bachata dance teacher in Santa Cruz, California.
